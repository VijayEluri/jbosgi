<b>This is the home page of the OSGi Trailblazer application.</b>
<p/>

It uses an imaginary shopping mall to demonstrate usage and best practices 
in <a href='http://www.osgi.org'>OSGi</a> general and of some of it's more advanced features
defined by the <a href='http://www.osgi.org/EEG/HomePage'>OSGi Enterprise Expert Group</a>.

<ul>
	<li>Service registration</li> 
	<li>Access to the naming and directory service (JNDI)</li> 
	<li>Access to the managment service (JMX)</li> 
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Component wiring and injection (Blueprint Service)</li> 
	<li>Access to the persistence service (JPA)</li>

</ul> 

The <a href='${trailblazer.java.path}/ShoppingMall.java'>ShoppingMall</a> application dynamically discovers
<a href='${trailblazer.java.path}/Shop.java'>Shop</a> instance from the OSGi Registry. 

Each shop is associated with a <a href='${trailblazer.java.path}/PaymentService.java'>PaymentService</a>. Shops define specific 
requirements on payment services. The ShoppingMall itself is rendered in HTML through the OSGi 
compendium provided <a href='http://www.osgi.org/javadoc/r4v41/org/osgi/service/http/HttpService.html'>HttpService</a>.
<p/>
 
Successful product purchases are passed through the <a href='${trailblazer.java.path}/AuditService.java'>AuditService</a> that is 
exposed through <a href='http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement'>JMX</a>.
<p/>

The individual Shops maintain their respective product lists using various technics available 
in <a href='http://www.osgi.org/EEG/HomePage'>OSGi EE</a>.
